Let's say that it's important to improve the recall score — that we want to be able to correctly label more of the cottonwood/willow trees as cottonwood/willow trees, even if that means accidentally labeling more ponderosa pine as cottonwood/willow incorrectly.\n",

    "In this lab, you completed an end-to-end machine learning modeling process with logistic regression on an imbalanced dataset. First you built and evaluated a baseline model. Next you wrote a custom cross validation function in order to use SMOTE resampling appropriately (without needing an `imblearn` pipeline). After that, you tuned the model through adjusting the regularization strength and the gradient descent hyperparameters. Finally, you evaluated your final model on log loss as well as more user-friendly metrics."
